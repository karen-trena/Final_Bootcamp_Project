# Final_Bootcamp_Project

To check the drafted project around the following topics, please refer to the [draft presentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lKzEe9153WNtvbnVDST4Clf0zZm7VSMF):
* Selected topic
* Reasons for the selected topic
* Questions that want to be answered.

As outlined in the presentation, the models that will be used are:
* **Kmeans clustering** to get to the personas will be directing the communication towards
* **Random forest** to be able to know what variables impact more in the generated personas and be able to predict the persona that best fits for future clients. For this, I attached the [documentation](https://github.com/karen-trena/Final_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/random%20forests.ipynb) worked on during the assigments of this bootcamp to be able to revisit and study.

The dataset that will be used is [here](https://github.com/karen-trena/Final_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/CCGENERAL.csv)

I will work on this project on my own because I wasn´t sure I was going to be able to finish the course. I had delays on my Challenge deliverables and had to work on those first. I didn´t want to delay anyone else with their own projects so I decided to work on my own.
